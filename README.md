# Greetings!

My name is Cassius Meeches, I am currently a CS student at the University of Manitoba.
I have a variety of interests which includes operating systems, back-end development, system infrastructure and security.

In this profile, you will find one of my personal projects "BurningGraphSim", a project that visually brings an
approximation algorithm to life. It was made using basic JavaScript and the p5.js library.

I am also currently working on the deployment of a human resources web application for a business called GetaServices.
It is an application that will handle various tasks for training companies on mall operational policies.
This involves features like scheduling of training sessions, storage of documents and employee info, etc.
